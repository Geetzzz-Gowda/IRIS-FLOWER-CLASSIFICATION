# IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION
The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their measurements.  Our objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.
